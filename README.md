## Hydrogen-bond rules

Hbind's rules for identifying hydrogen bonds protein-ligand interfaces are based on the criteria by Ippolito et al. [1] and McDonald and Thornton [2].

#### Hydrogen bond criteria:

- Hydrogen to acceptor distance: 1.5-2.5 Å
- Donor to acceptor distance: 2.4-3.5 Å
- Donor-H-acceptor angle (θ): 120-180°
- Pre-acceptor–acceptor–H angle (φ): 90-180°

(Hydrogen bonds must meet all of these criteria.)

#### Criteria for metal interactions:

- Lone pair atom distance to K or Na: 2.0-2.9 Å
- Lone pair atom distance to Ca, Co, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, or Zn: 1.7-2.6 Å

Additional command line options are available to list longer-range salt bridge interactions (up to 4.5 Å) and the number of hydrophobic contancts between protein and ligand atoms.
