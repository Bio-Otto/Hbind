## Installation

Installing Hbind requires [Perl](https://www.perl.org) and the [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org) compiler, both of which come pre-installed with most Unix- and Linux-based operating systems.

To install Hbind, simply download this repository, unpack it, and navigate into the main Hbind folder. Then, execute the following command in your terminal:

    perl install_hbind.pl

Upon successful installation, the hbind software will be ready to use from the `bin/` subdirectory. To show the help menu execute

    ./bin/hbind --help

and to show a brief usage example, run

    ./bin/hbind --usage

in your command line terminal. Please see the "[User Guide](user_guide.md)" section for more information on how to use Hbind.
